<h1>My favourite band. </h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Judah and The Lion is my favourite band. It is a <strong>folk and rock</strong> band. Judah and the Lion is a Nashville three-man band formed in 2011. Its band members met in Belmont
    University from where they formed the band. The band released their first album <em>'First Fruit'</em> in 2012. They later on went on to release other albums which did really well
     in Billboard charts and other music platforms. Their hit song <em>'Take it  all back'</em>  became #1 on U.S.alternative songs charts in 2016. I love Judah and the Lion because
      of their genre of music(folk and rock). I mean the banjo really gets me. I also love them for their sweet, catchy, sometime uplifting lyrics.
    Here  are some of their greatest tracks:</p>
