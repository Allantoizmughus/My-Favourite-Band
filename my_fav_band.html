<h1>My favourite band. </h1>
<p>Judah and The Lion is my favourite band. It is a folk and rock band. Judah and the Lion is a Nashville three-man band formed in 2011. Its band members met in Belmont
    University from where they formed the band. The band released their first album 'First Fruit' in 2012. They later on went on to release other albums which did really well
     in Billboard charts and other music platforms. Their hit song 'Take it  all back'  became #1 on U.S.alternative songs charts in 2016. I love JUdah and the Lion because
      of their genre of music(folk and rock). I mean the banjo really gets me. I also love them for their sweet, catchy, sometime uplifting lyrics.
    Here  are some of their greatest tracks:</p>
